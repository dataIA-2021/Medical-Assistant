The latter are called anticipatory attacks (DSM-IVR). Panic disorder is not the same as agoraphobia (fear of public places)', ' although many afflicted with panic disorder also suffer from agoraphobia. Panic attacks cannot be predicted', ' therefore an individual may become stressed', ' anxious or worried wondering when the next panic attack will occur. Panic disorder may be differentiated as a medical condition', ' or chemical imbalance. The DSM-IV-TR describes panic disorder and anxiety differently. Whereas anxiety is preceded by chronic stressors which build to reactions of moderate intensity that can last for days', ' weeks or months', ' panic attacks are acute events triggered by a sudden', ' out-of-the-blue cause: duration is short and symptoms are more intense. Panic attacks can occur in children', ' as well as adults.
